# July release

## What's new
- If you were searching for a supplier you'd need to enter your search query and then click the search button. We didn't think this was a good experience, I mean most of us are used to being able to press the 'Enter' key to take action--why not do the same of Hire Ground?

## Bug fixes
- Fixed: When some users completed their registration they may have noticed that the navigation bar didn't have any links. There's certainly more to the product than just a dashboard.
